 <h1> journal entries</h1> 


 <h2> journal entry #1 </h2> 

 	<p>In comp sci so far, we have learned how to use html to create different things on our website. I have enjoyed comp sci so far becuase I found it <em>very</em> exciting being able to make spinning squares and being able to create my own website. Even though, I have struggled a little bit throughout the process, in general I am understanding what is happening in the class and am enjoying it</p> 

 	<h2> journal entry #2 </h2>

 	<p> Today in comp sci, I added my website to the internet which is exciting. In additon, I feel like I am improving in understanding what is happening when I add my website to the intenet or when doing other things in sumbline text. I am very excited about my website!! <p>

 	<h2> journal entry #3 </h2> 

 	<p> In comp sci, I just created my first annimation. In the beggining I had a little difficultly figuring it out. Once I looked in up on google, it helped me to realize my error and later I figured it out. First I made a square move across the screen and then later I put a image instead so a dog was going back and forth on the screen. I am happy with how it turned out but I also wanna add a ball to the annimation to make it more interesting. </p>

 	<h2>journal entry #4</h2>

 	<p>For homework in comp sci we worked on created a digital card and adding an event listener to the card. At first, I was nervous to start becuase I was  not sure if I had remembered how to add an event listener. After looking at the previous event listener project that we did in class I remembered how to do it. I started by making my div and created all the atrbutes of it. Then I added my event listener with javascript, but the atributes weren't showing up in the color they normally do so I knew something was wrong. After figruing out that I had them in the wrong section of hmtl they changed to the right colors and I thought it would work. I opened it up in goggle and realized it didn't work. I am still unsure on why it is not working, but during class tommorow I hope to talk to Molly and ask her for some help<p>

 	<h2>journal entry #5</h2>

 	<p>In class and for homework, I was working on my square quilt. At first, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to make for it so I decided to just look for pictures that I wanted to make the quilt made of. After I had a problem with my one of my functions not working. I was struggling with it for a while, and then eventually found out what wasn't working. </p>
 	
 	<h2>journal entry #6</h2>

 	<p> My valentines day project was made through two event listeners one for my photo and one for the words on the screen. I started with the first event listener and used mousenter to have one photo change to another photo. Then I moved onto the text and this text also changed when the photo changed.</p>

 	<h2>journal entry #7</h2>
 	
 	<p>My circle project was made by using an event listener for the changing color in which you set x, y, x to random colors and referred back to them for the background color of the circle.</p>

 	<h2>journal entry #8<h2>
 	<p>for my slideshow project, I use Haikims website to help me make the parts of the slideshow.</p>
