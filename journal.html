 <h2> jounrnal entry #1 </h2> 

 	<p>In comp sci so far, we have learned how to use html to create different things on our website. I have enjoyed comp sci so far becuase I found it <em>very</em> exciting being able to make spinning squares and being able to create my own website. Even though, I have struggled a little bit throughout the process, in general I am understanding what is happening in the class and am enjoying it</p> 

 	<h2> jounral entry #2 </h2>
