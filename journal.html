 	<p> In comp sci so far, we have learned how to use html to create different things on our website. I have enjoyed comp sci so far becuase I found it <em>very</em> exciting being able to make spinning squares and being able to create my own website. Even though, I have struggled a little bit throughout the process, in general I am understanding what is happening in the class and am enjoying it <p>
