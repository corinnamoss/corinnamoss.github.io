 <h2> jounrnal entry #1 </h2> 

 	<p>In comp sci so far, we have learned how to use html to create different things on our website. I have enjoyed comp sci so far becuase I found it <em>very</em> exciting being able to make spinning squares and being able to create my own website. Even though, I have struggled a little bit throughout the process, in general I am understanding what is happening in the class and am enjoying it</p> 

 	<h2> jounral entry #2 </h2>

 	<p> Today in comp sci, I added my website to the internet which is exciting. In additon, I feel like I am improving in understanding what is happening when I add my website to the intenet or when doing other things in sumbline text. I am very excited about my website!! <p>

 	<h2> journal entry #3 </h2> 

 	<p> In comp sci, I just created my first annimation. In the beggining I had a little difficultly figuring it out. Once I looked in up on google, it helped me to realize my error and later I figured it out. First I made a square move across the screen and then later I put a image instead so a dog was going back and forth on the screen. I am happy with how it turned out but I also wanna add a ball to the annimation to make it more interesting. </p>
